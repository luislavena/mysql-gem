= Description

A win32 native build of the MySQL API module for Ruby.

= Dependencies

For this to work, you must have libmysql.dll in your PATH environmental variable. If you have MySQL installed locally,
just make sure that <mysql_install_dir>\bin is in your path. If you don't have MySQL installed locally, you can
install one or more of the MySQL tools, find the libmysql.dll included in their bin directory, and copy it to
the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder.

I can't include the dll here due to licensing conflicts.

= Installation

This package is only available for RubyGems, and only for Windows, so the installation method is:

 C:\> gem install mysql

= Documentation

Please see the README.html file in the 'docs' folder.
